# Motivation

This python package provides an implementation of visibility graph based approaches for detecting R-peaks in ECG signals.
The utilized visibility graph transformation maps a signal into a graph by representing sampling locations as nodes and establishing edges between mutually visible samples.
The visibility graph based methods showed a significantly superior performance compared to popular R-peak detectors in benchmarking on several databases and demonstrated their ability to detect R-peaks sample accurate

<!-- In benchmarking on several databases demonstrated a significantly superior performance of the VG-based methods compared to popular R-peak detectors and proved their ability to sample accurately detect R-peaks. -->



# Installation

You can install the 'vg-ecg-detectors' package from [GitHub](https://github.com/JonasEmrich/vg-ecg-detectors) with

``` 
pip install vg-ecg-detectors
```

# Quick Start

In the following, the basic usage of the 'FastNVG' detector utilizing the natural visibility graph for in th R-peak detection is illustrated.


## FastNVG

```{python, eval=FALSE}
from vg_ecg_detectors import FastNVG

detector = FastNVG(sampling_frequency=fs)
peaks_r, _ = detector.find_peaks(x)
```

## FastWHVG

```{python, eval=FALSE}
from vg_ecg_detectors import FastWHVG

detector = FastWHVG(sampling_frequency=fs)
peaks_r, _ = detector.find_peaks(x)
```
