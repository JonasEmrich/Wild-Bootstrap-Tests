# Fast and sample-accurate R-peak detectors based on visibility graphs

This python package provides an implementation of visibility graph based approaches for detecting R-peaks in ECG signals.

The R-peak detection algorithms were proposed in [1] and [2] were also their ability to sample accurately detect R-peaks was numerically shown. Furthermore, benchmarks on several databases demonstrated a
significantly superior performance of the VG-based methods compared to popular R-peak detectors.
