# Accelerated Sample-Accurate R-Peak Detectors Based on Visibility Graphs
This repository provides an algorithm for R-peak detection in ECG-signals based on a visibility graph approach. As part of my bachelor thesis, I modified an existing algorithm [1] and applied an acceleration technique [2] which was modified further. 
Those changes led to a significant improvement in terms of accuracy for the algorithm using the horizontal visibility graph, towards a level of the natural visibility graph or even greater. This was accomplished while the runtime was significantly reduced (for both visibility graph transformations).

## Used Python & Packages
- Python 3.10
- ts2vg 1.0.0
- scipy 1.8.0
- numpy 1.22.3

## Performance
The plot below shows the detection performance $F_1$-score of the proposed algorithms (visibility graph algorithms) against common detectors of the NeuroKit2 package on an ECG database of the University of Glasgow [3]. A tolerance window of +/-0 samples for a sample accurate evaluation was used.
